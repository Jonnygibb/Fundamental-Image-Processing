# Abstract

This technical report seeks to discuss whether, using only video cameras, autonomous driving can be achieved. The implementation of fundamental image processing techniques are later analysed with key findings summarised.

# Literature Review

# Image Processing Implementation
The fundamental functions to perform image processing in the spatial and frequency domain were implemented alongside this report. A Gaussian blur was used as the example kernel.

## Summary and Analysis
Noteable discoveries in computational time, padding types and complexity are summarised below.

### Computational Time of Spatial vs Frequency Domain
