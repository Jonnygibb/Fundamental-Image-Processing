  abstract  = "The chapter concerns the solutions of lane detection (LD) and
               lane tracking (LT) problems that are relevant in the
               implementation of lane departure warning systems (LDWSs), a kind
               of advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs) finalized to warn
               the driver that an imminent and possibly unintentional lane
               departure is taking place. The proposed solutions are based on
               simple image processing algorithms that work on the frames of a
               video stream of the oncoming road sections taken by a camera
               mounted on the front windshield of the vehicle. LD algorithms
               are finalized to identify the stripes demarcating the lane
               within a single frame, whereas LT algorithms try to track the
               demarcating stripes in subsequent frames of the stream. Final
               simulations on the software simulator CarSim 8 are also provided
               at the end of the chapter under realistic driving scenarios.",
